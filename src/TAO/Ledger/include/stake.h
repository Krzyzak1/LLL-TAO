/**
 *  The functions defined here provide a single source for settings and calculations related to Nexus Proof of Stake.
 *
 *  Settings-related functions replace direct references to defined constants in the code, allowing for
 *  activation-triggered changes to be coded in one place rather than in multiple places throughout the code.
 *  Any other changes, such as alternative forms of definition, would also be encapsulated within
 *  these functions and not require any change elsewhere in the code.
 *
 *  Similarly, functions that perform calculations isolate the definition of these calculations into a
 *  single location, supporting use in multiple places while only having the calculation itself
 *  coded once.
